# employee incentive plan

Reading the plain numbers of an share-based payment plan e.g. within the Baloise Group [financial statements](https://www.baloise.com/en/home/investors/publications/financial-statements.html) and [annual report](https://www.baloise.com/dam/baloise-com/documents/de/publikationen/jahresabschluss/2018/annual-report-baloise-group-2018.pdf) section 18.4 (page 225) can be pretty tough.

Hence this repository (visually and interactively) demonstrates some of the potential outcomes of such a plan by using the [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) tool [Portfolio Performance](https://www.portfolio-performance.info).
